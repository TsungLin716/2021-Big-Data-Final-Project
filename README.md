# 2021-Big-Data-Final-Project(CS-GY_6513)
This is a final project of the Big Data course at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Basically, our goal is to create a process model for NYU Open Data(DOB). This project includes the technique such as data profiling, data cleaning, similarity calculation, precision and recall.

**Data Profiling** is to extract the actionable metrics about the data's quality. It allows us to determine which column is having an issue so that we can categorize our research problem.

**Data Cleaning** is to address the problems we found from Data Profiling, this includes the mispelled and unstandarized data that lurking within the datasets. We applied our code with several customized functions and algorithms to modify the data so that they are in a unite and correct format for further utilization.

**Similarity Calculation** is the technique that if we encountered a huge dataset, we can extract an amount of sample data which based on the confidence interval and confidence level.

**Precision and Recall** is to examine the effectiveness of our cleaning method. In our project, we decided to use Jaccard Similarity.

## How to run the project?
You can follow the Readme.md in folder **part1** and **part2** to run the code. We suggest you start from **part1**
